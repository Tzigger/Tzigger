# Hey there, I'm Tzigger! 🚀

## Welcome to My GitHub Page!😁

## Who am I?
I'm a computer science student who's also a ChatGpt enthusiast🤣. You'll usually find me knee-deep in code, fixing some bugs, or cracking some hack-the-box levels🤓

## What Gets Me Pumped?🧐
- **Scripting**: I love whipping up scripts to make life easier – who needs manual tasks, right?
- **Data Diving**: Dive into data? Count me in! It's like being a detective in the digital world.
- **Pentesting sh*t**: To keep things safe and sound in cyberspace, someone's gotta crack it too!

## What's Brewing in My Lab?
I am working on some interesting projects🤭 From fun ideas to hopefully useful tools😝.

## Let's Code!
Got an idea you wanna bounce around? Or maybe you just wanna talk about the latest technologies? Hit me up – I'm always down for a good chat!
